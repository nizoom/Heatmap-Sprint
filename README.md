# Hey CUSPers! Welcome to the heatmap sprint repo and notebook

#### Here's a breakdown of the notebook we'll be looking at:

We'll be downloading some NYC Census data that shows the city's population at 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2010. Then we'll make a heatmap to show how the population has changed over time across the 5 boroughs.

Next we'll be downloading a shapefile of NYC community districts to create a spatial map of the city. The data in this file defines the borders of the community districts.

There will be more details inside the notebook itself.

#### Tools used in the notebook:
